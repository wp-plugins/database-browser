Easily query and browse tables in your database, and download in XML, JSON, CSV and HTML format

== Description ==

Ever needed to check some data in one of your WordPress database tables, but don't have PHPMyAdmin available? Now you can easily query your data and export it in HTML, XML, CSV and JSON formats with a simple plugin.

There are other options, for example you can write your own 'where' and 'order by' clauses, and pagination is built-in. You can also see the complete query run against your database.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install from the Plugin browser
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I delete my data? =

Yes, it is possible to delete or modify data using the custom query, 'Where' and 'Order by' boxes. Be careful.

= Who can export the data? =

Only people with export permisions - the people who can run your WordPress export file.
